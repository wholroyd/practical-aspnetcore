# HX-Trigger Response Header with JSON payload

This example demonstrates the usage of `HX-Trigger` response header to emit custom events with JSON payload at the client([doc](https://htmx.org/headers/hx-trigger/)).

We are using the nice utilities provided by the excellent [Htmx](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Htmx) package.

```csharp
htmx.MapGet("/", (HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response) =>
{
    response.Htmx(x =>
    {
        x.WithTrigger("show-me", new { message = "GET request" });
    });

    return Results.Content($"GET => {DateTime.UtcNow}");
});
```
