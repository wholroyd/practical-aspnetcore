# Multiple Form Handling in Blazor SSR - Automatic binding using EditForm and [SupplyParameterFromForm]

This example shows how to perform **multiple** automatic data binding for a form `POST` request using `<EditForm/>` and `[SupplyParameterFromForm]`. `EditForm` will generate the antiforgery token so there is no need to include `<AntiforgeryToken/>` component manually.


## Important

Blazor SSR does not allow class with multiple constructors to be used as a model. This also applies to nested objects (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/55711).
