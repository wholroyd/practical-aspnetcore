# Form Handling in Blazor SSR - Automatic binding using [SupplyParameterFromForm] 

This example shows how to perform automatic data binding for a form `POST` request using `[SupplyParameterFromForm]`. We will use normal `<form>` tag in this case. Never forget to include `<AntiforgeryToken />` in your form otherwise your POST request won't be processed. 


## Important

Blazor SSR does not allow class with multiple constructors to be used as a model. This also applies to nested objects (https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/55711).
